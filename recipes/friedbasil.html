        <h4>In Thailand if you can't figured it out what to eat, Let try this!</h4>
        <h5>Stir hot chilli with pork or chicken and top with basil</h5>

        <p>This is a staple of Thai cooking. Adjust the spices to your own tastes for a really great use for leftover rice!!<br/>
           I get the basil from a local Asian market. It has a different flavor than that of regular basil and makes all the difference in this recipe.<br/>
           It is fast and fairly easy to make, but requires constant stirring.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup peanut oil for frying</li>
                <li>4 cups cooked jasmine rice, chilled</li>
                <li>6 large cloves garlic clove, crushed</li>
                <li>2 serrano peppers, crushed</li>
                <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips</li>
                <li>1 red pepper, seeded and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>2 cups sweet Thai basil</li>
                <li>1 cucumber, sliced (Optional)</li>
                <li>½ cup cilantro sprigs (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together the oyster sauce, fish sauce, and sugar in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Add the garlic and serrano peppers, stirring quickly.<br/>
                    Stir in the chicken, bell pepper, onion and oyster sauce mixture; cook until the chicken is no longer pink. Raise heat to high and stir in the chilled rice; stir quickly until the sauce is blended with the rice. Use the back of a spoon to break up any rice sticking together.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and mix in the basil leaves. Garnish with sliced cucumber and cilantro as desired.</li>
            </ol>
