        <h5>Green spicies melts in coconut milk with chicken such a good for lunch or dinner</h5>
        
        <p>This is a green curry recipe I've cobbled together over the years. The vegetables aren't completely traditional,<br/>
            but they give the whole thing a good texture and variety.<br/>
            Often asked for in my household, hopefully it'll become a favorite in yours. Serve over rice.</p>

            <li>1 (1/4 inch thick) slice ginger, finely grated</ls>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</ls>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can baby corn pieces, drained </ls>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) can bamboo shoots, drained</ls>
            <li>2 (13.5 ounce) cans coconut milk</ls>
            <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</ls>
            <li>2 tablespoons palm sugar</li>
            <li>6 kaffir lime leaves</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 orange bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>¼ cup thinly sliced Thai basil, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a wok until it starts to shimmer. Add curry paste, garlic, and ginger; stir together and fry until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes.<br/>
                Add chicken breast slices, stirring until coated. Cook until just slightly pink in the center, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                While chicken is cooking, place baby corn and bamboo shots in a small saucepan, cover with water, and place over high heat. Bring to a boil.<br/>
                Drain then cover with water again.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour coconut milk into the wok. Bring to a slow simmer, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Drain corn and bamboo shoots and add in.<br/>
                Stir in fish sauce, palm sugar, and kaffir lime leaves. Bring back up to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.<br/>
                Stir in bell pepper strips and cook until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove curry from heat and stir in Thai basil.
            </li>
        </ol>
